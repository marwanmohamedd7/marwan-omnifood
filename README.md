## About Omnifood

Omnifood is a technology company focused on improving consumer well-being through healthy diets. With busy lives filled with work, family, and other important activities, many people find it challenging to maintain a nutritious diet. Omnifood addresses this issue with an AI-driven approach to meal planning and delivery.

Using our app, users can select dietary preferences, including foods they like or dislike. Our AI algorithm then generates a custom, weekly meal plan tailored to individual tastes and nutritional needs. In partnership with local restaurants and cooking partners, we cook and deliver these meals directly to our users’ doors in select cities. The service is offered as a monthly subscription, with options for one or two meals per day.
